# Daisy-Hackathon
Submission for Daisy Intelligence hackathon, where I received 3rd place.

The prompt is to customize a race car and specify its directional control to navigate a race track with given radii of curvature, without veering off the track. The QoR for my submission is 30% higher than average.
